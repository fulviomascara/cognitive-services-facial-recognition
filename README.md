# Cognitive Services for Computer Vision - Facial Recognition
### Talk in TDC SP 2019 Event<br>Track: Cognitive Computing<br>Date: Jun, 16 2019

**Comparison between three vendors:**
- Amazon Rekognition
- Microsoft Face API
- IBM Watson Visual Recognition

**After this comparison, you'll be able to:**
- Store images in a "database" for using in facial recognition
- "Train" model with faces database, generating face embeddings (faceprints)
- Run face recognition on a new image
- Draw Bounding Boxes for face matches, with info (confidence/accuracy, name)
- Draw Bounding Boxes for face unmatches, with "unknown label"
- Compare two images to see if is the same person (bonus)
